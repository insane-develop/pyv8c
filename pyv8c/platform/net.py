"""Host-side HTTP for one page: ``page.net.get(...)``, ``page.net.post(...)``.

Driving a page from Python usually means talking to the same site it is on.  That
means sending the cookies it collected, the headers a browser would send, and
doing it over whichever transport the page itself uses -- cycronet, curl_cffi or
a host-supplied engine (see ``network/registry.py``).  This facade is that
shortcut.

It lives in the platform layer because it holds the context's transport and its
cookie jar, neither of which ``web/**`` may reach by name.  It never touches V8,
and nothing of it is visible to page code: a page sends its own requests through
``fetch``/XHR, which take the resource path instead.
