"""What a class states about itself, and how that becomes a native interface description.

A class answers members by convention -- ``fn_<name>`` for an operation, ``get_<name>`` and
``set_<name>`` for an attribute -- and takes place, arity, flags and writability from the IDL
document.  A class states only what the document cannot decide::

    @interface("AbortSignal", "EventTarget")
    class AbortSignal(EventTarget):
        __idl_overrides__ = {"abort": {"callback": "fn_static_abort"}}

Interface-level answers -- the interceptor hooks a collection needs, for one -- go under the
``"interface"`` key of that same mapping::

    __idl_overrides__ = {"interface": {"name_get": "__v8_name_get__"}}

This is the only module that knows the native ``IdlSpec``/``MethodSpec``/``AttributeSpec``
builders, and the only place an override is checked: an unknown member, an unknown field, or a
field the member's kind cannot answer is refused here, before a page ever sees it.
