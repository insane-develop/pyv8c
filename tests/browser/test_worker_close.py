"""A worker's teardown is the host's problem, never the script's.

``close()`` and ``terminate()`` answer ``undefined`` in a browser however the teardown goes.
The host's guard, though, raises ``RealmBusyError`` when a realm will not answer it -- and both
calls are made from a script, so without a boundary at the call a page ends up catching the
host's own scheduler.  This holds that boundary down at both ends: the worker that closes
itself, and the page that terminates it, with the reason logged either way.

The teardown itself is *posted* to the worker's own thread rather than waited for there, so a
worker that is slow to answer costs the caller nothing; the last two tests hold that down from
inside the page's realm, and hold down that the posted teardown still runs.
