"""DOM/BOM members a challenge reads, and the differences a two-sided surface diff found.

Measured against Chrome 154 on 2026-10-07 with ``examples/5s/script/surface_diff.py`` -- the same
page, the same probe, both engines, comparing every member of ~86 DOM/BOM objects by kind
(accessor, value, function arity).  Two of the three classes are guarded here:

* a member this engine carried that Chrome has nowhere (``Event.prototype.persisted``,
  ``Performance.navigation_id``) -- a fingerprint in the direction that is easy to miss, because
  the page reads a value where Chrome reads ``undefined``;
* a member Chrome has and this engine does not, **when the engine can declare it**.  ``Response``
  is the example that cannot: its static ``json`` shares a name with the instance method, and a
  member table is keyed by name, so the guard watches the instance one instead.

The third class -- members the baseline itself has nowhere to put, such as the eight ``2d``
context attributes -- is a data gap with no honest assertion available until the baseline is
regenerated; it is written down in ``examples/5s/README.md`` and in ``html_canvas.py``.

A fourth is not about members but about the object holding them: a callback interface has no
``prototype``, which Blink states in ``SetupIDLCallbackInterfaceTemplate`` and this engine had
to learn (see the ``NodeFilter`` case below).
