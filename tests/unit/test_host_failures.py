"""A failure of the host's own scheduling is not something a script may observe.

The executor's guard raises :class:`RealmBusyError` when a realm will not answer, and the
bridge hands whatever escapes a Python callback to whoever called in -- including a page.
No browser ever fails a script for the host's own reason, so ``host_boundary`` is where it
stops: JavaScript being on the stack *is* the boundary, and what the script loses in
visibility the log keeps.  The same rule holds where an exception is not thrown at a
caller at all -- a task that raised, and the error events a realm reports.
