"""Every declaration in ``__idl_overrides__`` has to say something the IDL does not.

The IDL owns the shape -- which members exist, where they live, their arity and their flags --
and the ``fn_``/``get_``/``set_`` convention answers the members a class implements.  A
declaration that repeats either is noise that can drift, so this freezes what the audit found
when the declaration surface moved to ``__idl_overrides__`` (2026-10-07,
``python -m pyv8c.tools.idl_audit``): each batch of that work lowers a number, and the two in
``NOISE`` end at zero.

#: class answers differently, under another name, or installs on an interface the IDL only
#: resolves elsewhere.
#:
#: ``flags`` fell to zero when the last three handler declarations stopped claiming a side effect
#: the document does not state: the flags are the document's, and a class that contradicts them
#: is a change to what V8 may elide, which is not a declaration worth a line.
#:
#: ``restating`` is a residue, not a target met: what is left is the same kind of line in the
#: interfaces whose member list is also a *body* (``ValidityState``'s flags,
#: ``PerformanceTiming``'s timings), where taking the name out of the list would take the
#: implementation with it.  ``DOMException``/``DOMError`` left it when the core feature stopped
#: restating their getters' side effect -- the document already states it, and the compiled spec
#: is unchanged without those lines (measured: two dumps, byte-identical).  The counts below may
#: only fall.
