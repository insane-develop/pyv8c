"""Deterministic regressions for the four concurrency/lifecycle defects.

Functional tests cannot catch these defects because reproducing them needs a
specific interleaving, which almost never occurs in a single happy-path run:

- A1 -- ``DevToolsTarget.close()`` used to resolve its realm owner with a
  single attribute lookup that never succeeds for a Page (the executor lives
  on ``Page.realm``).  ``Debugger.disconnect`` therefore ran on whichever
  thread happened to close the target, breaking the single-owner invariant.
- A2 -- ``TaskQueue.pump_until`` could sleep out a delivery whose notification
  landed in the window between turning the loop and going to sleep.
- A3 -- an exception raised by a ``RealmExecutor.post()`` command has no
  Future to mirror onto and used to vanish inside the owner thread.
- A4 -- a fetch/XHR or document-subresource response that completed before its
  handle was registered left the cancel callback registered for the lifetime
  of the page.

These are marked ``race``; CI re-runs them with ``pytest-repeat --count`` so a
scheduling change cannot hide behind one lucky pass.
